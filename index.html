                  <p> I, usually, don’t like chatting with Uber/Lyft drivers because I like to make my trip as quiet as possible or even take a nap during it if it’s a long one. Sometimes, though, I find drivers who are very pleasant and interesting that they grab my attention, which makes me talk to them even if I don’t feel like it just because they draw a difference. My driver today was Melissa, a Cuban-American lady in her fifties. I was 3 minutes late when she arrived to my address as I went to throw a trash bag. I got a message from her saying, “take your time:)”.</p>
                  <p>I then realized my driver was going to be really good. Her car was so clean and the air condition was the way I wanted. Soukous music was playing in the car. While I was buckling up, Melissa turned the music down and offered some chocolate, which was in a small decorated box beside me in the back seat. (I stopped eating most kinds of sweets recently, especially orange juice, for the sake of my dental health).</p>

              <div class="col-md-3">
                <p>I thanked her and apologized as I couldn’t eat her chocolate. “Is your Arabic Palestinian?!” the driver asked. I wondered how she knew that I was Arab or that my language was Arabic. Maybe from my name? But my name is used in Arab and non-Arab regions. Not every Mohammed/Muhammed/Mohammad/ Muhammad is Arab. How was she so sure that I was Palestinian? These were my thoughts in a couple of seconds before I answered her question. “Oh ha ha, how did you know?” I smiled.</p>

                <p>“I have no idea. I just can tell from the eyes!” Half of my face was covered with a mask, but she was right… I am Palestinian! “My Aunt’s husband is Palestinian from Haifa.” She continued, “He came to the states in 1978 few years before I came with my parents from Cuba. I was a kid, who just followed her parents to make their dreams come true.” She paused after swallowing her saliva for a few seconds because, I think, she remembered her childhood as a daughter of immigrants and the suffering her parents had once they came to this country! “Every week, I could see my parents only for few hours during one day of the weekend. They worked from morning to late night, 6 days a week.”</p>

                <p>Life in the US is pretty expensive, especially for those with low income and for new comers to the country. Not working for long hours, most of the time, does not cover the expenses of housing, food and even transportation. As someone new to the US, I can relate to this and I feel what she felt when she was a child. “I cannot remember any beautiful moments in my childhood for almost three years from the first day we came here. Few years later, I lost my mom!” she cried.</p>
                <p>I had nothing to tell her other than being silent and showing my condolences to her, “I am sorry for your loss!”. “Thank you Mohammed. I now have two jobs to try make a living for my son who is 16. I don’t want him to live the life I lived. </p>
                <p> I don’t want him to feel what I felt. More than that, I don’t want him to lose me just like I lost my mom. It hurts. I swear it does!”. Her words saddened me, and I actually had tears in my eyes. “I don’t tell this story to just anybody. You know, not everyone understands how I feel.” She sniffed, “I told you because you people have been suffering since 1948, and the situation in your country is getting worse and worse. The number of Palestinian refugees outside Palestine is in millions. Our country, Cuba, has the same story.” “We are almost there…” she said.</p>

                <p>I frankly wanted her to stop taking about her pain because it reminds of of pain I had and of pain I wanted to get rid of. I asked her if she knew any Arabic.Before dropping me off to my destination, Melissa mentioned some Arabic common words her aunt’s husband taught her. She said she knew how to curse in Arabic as well, but she refused to mention them. I thanked god that she didn’t curse because I barely do and I don’t like listening to cursing most of the time.</p>
                <p>Like thousands and thousands of immigrants, all what Melissa wanted was someone to listen to her story. For reasons I don’t know, Melissa doesn’t want to share her story just with anyone because she knows no one can understand her but those experienced what she went through. Many people will never understand what immigrants go through even if they listen to their stories daily and nightly. They are stuck between the hammer of not being able to go back to their home countries and the anvil of not being able to legalize their statuses in the host countries.</p>
